# An overview of the project.

## Titel: How my learning process starts with Excel in the Data Technician Bootcamp with Just IT.

### Aim: My learning process start with Cleaning and preparation of data, how to use Excel Functions and formulas for effective analysis.


This process makes me to give data cleaning and preparation top priority in all of my projects because they are essential steps that immediately affect the precision and dependability of the outcomes and, as a result, guarantee improved business strategies and insights. Below are some of the cleaning and preparation I do in all my projects.

* **Removing Duplicates:** I identify and remove duplicate records.
* **Handling Missing values:** I identify missing values and assess their impact. I remove rows and columns with excessive missing values.
* **Standardizing Data Formats:** I ensure consistency in formats such as date formats et al.
* **Handling Outliers:** I detect outliers then I decide if to remove extreme values base on the dataset's context.
* **Removing Unnecessary Data:** I drop irrelevant columns that do not contribute to the analysis. I remove also unwanted characters or whitespace in text fields.
* **Creating  Necessary Data:** I used tools like Excel function, DAX in power BI, Calculated Fields in Tableau and codes in both SQL and Python to create necessary columns required for the analysis.

## Below are some of the print of data cleaning and preparation:

![Day 2 Task 1 (4)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94170b84-197e-4a72-badc-1a8194513a28)

* I used Unique function to fill the product category under Product types.

* I used the Sum function to calculate the total sales for all products.

* I used the IF & IFS function to calculate the total sales & average sale for each product category (Clothing, Beauty & Electronics) and total sale for gender (Male & Female).
  
* I used conditional formatting on the average sales to highlights the high value with green and the lowest with red.


**See the below print**

**Sources: Just IT**

The dataset below tracks the sales performance of different products in various counties in England. Please paste the dataset into a blank Excel workbook. Your task is to:
•	Create a Pivot Table to summarise the data by county and product.
•	Use the SWITCH function to categorise products based on their sales volume.
